Iterables: Anything that we can loop over in python is called an Iterables.
for eg:
    [1, 2, 3]
- In python an object which implements the __iter__() methods is called an Iterables.

python Iterators: 
    - Iterator in python is simply an object that can return data one at a time while iterating over it.
    - For an object to be an iterator, it must implement two methods:
            __iter__() --- iter()
                __next__() --- next()
did you know?
- for loop internally use the while loop to iterate through sequeces.



Python Generator:
- A Generator is  an elegant way to create custom iterators in python that makes it really easy to work with iterator
- class Even:
    pass
- function with yield(keyword)


def even():
    x = 0

    x += 2
    yield x

    x += 2
    yield x

    x += 2
    yield x


difference b/w return and yield


fibonacci Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, .....
