Packages: folder, dir
    - We don't usually store all of our files on our computer in the same location. 
    - We use a well-organized hierarchy of directories for easier access.
    - Python has packages for directories and modules for files.
    - As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, 
        we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages.
        This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear.

    - Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages 
        and modules.
    - dir()



__init__.py:
    - A directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order for Python to consider it as a package.
    - This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.
