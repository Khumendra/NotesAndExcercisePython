Module: 
    - Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.
    - A file containing Python code, for example: example.py, is called a module,
        and its module name would be example.
    - We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files.
        Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.
    - We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, 
        instead of copying their definitions into different programs.
