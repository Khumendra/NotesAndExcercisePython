Decorator: 
  - Decorator allows us to "decorate" a function.
  - Decorator allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object.
  
  - Functions in python are first class object/citizens. 
  - This means that they support operations such as being passed as an argument, returned from a function,
  - and assigned to a variable.
  - on/off switch to quickly add this functionality


Imagine you created a function:

  def simple_function():
        # Do Somthing
        # ....
        return something



  def simple_function2():
        # job of a function
        ....
        return ...

Two options:
  * Add extra code
  or 
  * create new function that contains your old code and then new code that does somthing.
  * What if you then want to remove that extra functionality.
  * on/off switch to quickly add this functionality
