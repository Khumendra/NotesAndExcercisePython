Exception (user's mistakes)
    - We can make certain mistakes while writing a program that lead to errors when we try to run it.
      A python program terminates as soon as it encounters an unhandled error.

    These errors can be broadly classified into two classes:
    1. Syntax errors 
    2. Logical errors (Exceptions)
    3. Runtime(User-Based Error)

Exception Handling:
    - Process of responding to exceptions in a custom way during the execution of program.

process of exception Handling:
    - Find Error - If we don't python will.
    - Take Caution - try
    - Fix Error - raise

Important Terms: 
    - try(keyword): risky code 
    - except(keyword): execute when there is an exception.
    - else(keyword): No exception? Run this code
    - finally(keyword): Always run this code

Syntax:
    try:
        # code that may cause exception
    else:
        # code to run when exception occurs

Handling Specific Exception:

Python try... finally



print(dir(locals()['__builtins__']))
