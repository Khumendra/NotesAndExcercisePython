Duck Typing: 
    In Python, we follow a principle - If 'it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it must be duck' 
    which means python doesn't care about which class of object it is, if it is an object and required
    behavior is present for that object then it will work. The type of object is distinguished only at
    runtime. This is called as duck typing.khumendradatapoint@gmail.com
